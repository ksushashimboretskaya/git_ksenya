Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my aching soul?

I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in a new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you play for me at your show
And all the ways, I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul
